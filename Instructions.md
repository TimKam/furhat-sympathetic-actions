# Human-Computer Interaction Experiment - Instructions
*Interactive and Intelligent Systems  Group, Ume√• University. Winter 2018/2019.*

Dear study participant,

thank you for volunteering for this study.
In this experiment, we ask you to play a game with a robot (the robot name is *Furhat*).
The experiment will help us gain insights into how humans react to specific types of robot behavior.

The game is a two-player game and goes over several turns.
Each turn goes like this:

1.  One player has 100 virtual coins at their disposal.
    Let us call this player the 'proposer'.
    They can split the coins in any way between themselves and the other player.
    They cannot split a single coin into more parts, though.

2.  The other player can either accept or reject the offer. We call this player the 'responder'.
    If the responder accepts the offer, both players will receive the coins as split by the proposer.
    If the responder rejects the offer, nobody will receive any coins.

First, the Furhat robot will play the role of the 'proposer' and you will be the 'responder'.
Then, we will take turns and change roles.
In total, we will play **three sessions** with **six rounds** each.
Feel free to make notes about the amount of coins you received after each turn.

Depending on the amount of coins you receive during the game, you will rewarded with more or less sweets for participating in the experiment.

Let's play!
